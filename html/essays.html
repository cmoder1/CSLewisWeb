                    <p>Animals had a great importance in C.S. Lewis life. His love and interest in animals is apparent when examining personal anecdotes, his letters, essays, fictional works and Christian apologetics. Lewis was even known to prefer feeding the mice found in his house or office. Lewis most famously demonstrated his love of animals in his children’s fantasy series, The Chronicles of Narnia and his adult science-fiction series, The Space Trilogy. Animals feature as key characters, demonstrate agency, and are portrayed in an egalitarian light. However, in both series, the conceptualized division between talking and non-talking non-human animals recurs... Through an examination of the characterizations in both series, the larger theological theories, and Lewis’ academic essays on vivisection, it can be argued that Lewis was indeed an ardent advocate of animals.</p>

                    <p>In his book, The Language of God, Francis Collins argues that scientific and religious worldviews are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As the leading physician and a geneticist who lead the Human Genome Project, he experienced a radical change in his beliefs on the existence of God that was fueled by one-on-one experiences with his patients and his encounter with the writings of C.S. Lewis. In The Language of God, he outlines the story of his conversion and proposes the concept of Biologos, a philosophy that accepts science as true but also permits the belief in the existence of an all-loving, omnipotent God. </p>

                    <p>Some say that great art is simply a reimagining of old art. Many movies put a modern day spin on Shakespeare’s tales. Shakespeare retold classical writers like Ovid and Apuleius. Ovid, Apuleius, and other writers of old retold the myths they had heard as children. In Perelandra, C.S. Lewis joins this tradition in his reimagining of the Garden of Eden with his references to ancient myth and the Bible.</p>

                    <p>In many of his works, Clive Staples Lewis explores the nuanced but critical difference between the concepts of submission and surrender. The two may be parts of the same process, but in terms of a Christian’s relationship to God, Lewis draws a marked distinction. Whereas submission can be understood as yielding to a higher will or authority, surrender connotes a complete abandonment of one’s self to a being or force. Lewis explores the interaction of the two in the context of theology through both fiction and nonfiction, ultimately arguing that, while submission may be a step in the direction of surrender, the progression of the former to the latter is preferable and perhaps even necessary in the realm of God. In this paper I will examine this argument primarily through its prominence in <em>The Great Divorce</em>, while also bringing in support and comparison from instances of submission and surrender evident in other works of Lewis’ fiction and nonfiction. </p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Although C.S. Lewis is perhaps best known for his works of fantasy, he penned several nonfiction works, which provide readers with fascinating explorations on moral and religious issues and serve as a lens into his soul. One of these works, <em>The Problem of Pain</em>, discusses the implications of suffering in a Christian context, and a later chapter examines pain experienced by animals. Throughout this chapter, Lewis makes several claims regarding animal suffering that reveal his feelings towards non-human animals, and as such one would expect these beliefs to pervade through all of his other works. This is in fact the case, and Lewis’ novels are rife with animal characters, both non-human and anthropomorphized, that are described and treated in a manner which corresponds to his writings on non-human suffering. </p>

                        <p class="abstract">“Every one of us lives only to journey further and further into the mountains” (Lewis, <em>"The Great Divorce"</em> 74). This is an apt analogy for my experience reading Lewis’s own preface, A Preface to Paradise Lost. My appreciation for his brilliance has only grown, and my respect for him as a scholar has enhanced my respect for him as a fiction writer. In the following pages I will outline what it is like to read Lewis the critic, how his critical thinking can elucidate moments in his fiction, and, briefly, describe the way his work on Milton differs from my own.</p>

                    <p>When Emeth confesses to Aslan that he is no son of his but a servant of Tash, Aslan responds, “Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me” (Lewis 757). Emeth is a Hebrew word for “truth.” At the heart of Emeth is a steadfast yearning to know the truth, and in our world, this same yearning compels human beings to think and re-think what the truth really is. To a degree, I empathize with Emeth because all his life, he thought he was living rightly; he thought he was serving the One true God, when in reality, he was actually serving a false one. I, too, had been serving false idols; by chasing the things of this world --- money, validation and status, among other things --- I had neglected the things of heaven. I had neglected God. However, by the mercy of God, He opened my eyes to the truth. Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life. It is by His death and resurrection that we are saved, that we are given a place in heaven to be with Him forever.</p>

                    <p>The term “myth,” for many, conjures up images of giants and centaurs, goblins and orcs, dragons and elves. Some of our minds may grasp at the images of the powerful Greek gods of Olympus, while others clamber to recall the legendary Norse inhabitants of Asgard. We imagine fantasy stories—stories from books we have read, of long journeys, heroes, monsters, and demons. Some people might fondly recall an image of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels or a golden ring glowing red with otherworldly runes. That these latter two images are associated with mythologies of ancient cultures in our minds is a testament to artistic skills of two of the most prominent literary figures in history, C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, the authors, most famously, of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, respectively. What is perhaps more astounding, however, is that these two writers, as Christians, were able to create such fantastical worlds rich in their own origin stories, mythologies, gods, songs, cultures, languages, beliefs, races, and ideals, seemingly separate from traditional Christian thought.  </p>
