Ten hands took and ate, five mouths puckered and drank. Then each turned to their side, picked up the small canister beside their seat, and released the watery mush from their mouths back to the world. The time when all the dreams of the world was satisfied, all the drooling and gazing and anxious imagining of every marvelous food. Tea time was the time without responsibility, the time when pleasure was the only goal, the time to eat...<br>
                    A time for eating and a time for drinking,<br>

She sees a butterfly, the same black and yellow ones she used to see in the garden of her home, and she only thinks of the fleeting nature of its wings, how one day it, too, will die.</p>

And at the same time, with ear-shattering cracks and creaks, the rocks moved. Already, while they looked, the chasm was narrower. From every side belated gnomes were rushing into it. They would not wait to climb down the rocks. They flung themselves headlong and, either because so strong a blast of hot air was beating up from the bottom, or for some other reason, they could be seen floating downwards like leaves. Thicker and thicker they floated, till their blackness almost blotted out the fiery river and the groves of live gems."<br>

Puddleglum grabbed for both of them, but at that moment the rocks on which he stood gave way, and all three of them plunged together into the brightness.</p>

                    “What are you talking about H?” asked the other girl. This one didn’t have that hint of <em>something</em> in her voice. Her voice was harsh, almost cruel. <br>
                    “Across the river,” replied H. She strained her eyes, trying to see more than just dim lights through the thick fog that rose from the water like a curtain.<br>
