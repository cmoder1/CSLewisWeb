Ten hands took and ate, five mouths puckered and drank. Then each turned to their side, picked up the small canister beside their seat, and released the watery mush from their mouths back to the world. The time when all the dreams of the world was satisfied, all the drooling and gazing and anxious imagining of every marvelous food. Tea time was the time without responsibility, the time when pleasure was the only goal, the time to eat...<br>
                    A time for eating and a time for drinking,<br>
                    This is the time for eating.</p>
